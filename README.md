The propose of this git repository is to practice python and general coding
skills. As a primary source of material I will be using Project Euler practice
problems. The title of each python file corresoponds to the Project Euler
problem.

Additional problems will be added beyond Project Eueler. These will either be
practice white board problems (provided by mentors), cracking the codeing
interview (denoted by ci prefix) or other independent sources.
